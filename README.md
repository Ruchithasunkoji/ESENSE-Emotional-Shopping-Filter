# ESENSE-Emotional-Shopping-Filter

E‑Sense is an AI-powered tool that detects manipulative language in e-commerce product descriptions and suggests ethical rewrites. It uses DistilBERT for classification, T5 for rewriting, and provides an ethical score for each description. The system supports text input or product URLs via a Streamlit interface and helps consumers make informed, ethical shopping decisions.
